INFO:root:[05:35] Ula (1.0000): Because
INFO:root:[05:36] Tom (1.0000): they're making the thing. So you have to... It's not like they can just send you one for free.

INFO:root:[05:43] Tom (1.0000): ourselves, but not like... It's not free.

INFO:root:[06:26] Tom (1.0000): Well, we've been here three years. It must
INFO:root:[06:27] Ula (0.9889): be
INFO:root:[06:27] Tom (1.0000): maybe more than five years.
INFO:root:[06:29] Ula (1.0000): Yeah,
INFO:root:[06:30] Tom (1.0000): but it's been watched that many times because the letters are starting to crack a little bit. I
INFO:root:[06:35] Ula (1.0000): really like his... This is from an American company.
INFO:root:[06:39] Tom (1.0000): No, European. Oh, from an European country. Well, I think there is a base in America. They have like a printers in America and they have a base in... Europe.

INFO:root:[07:09] Tom (0.8073): , 很便宜。
INFO:root:[07:10] Ula (0.9999): 但是我们的衣服的品质真的很好。  我很喜欢。
INFO:root:[07:14] Tom (1.0000): Now, in other news, I want to say. What I want to do is a really, that was a  关波的错。
INFO:root:[07:24] Ula (0.9382): 什么意思 ?
INFO:root:[07:26] Tom (0.9999): 谁的错 ?  我说 ,  我要说 , 然后我喝我的茶。
INFO:root:[07:32] Ula (1.0000): 对。
INFO:root:[07:32] Tom (1.0000): So I said, I want to say, and then I stopped, and then drank my tea. That was just a faux pas, because you also drank your smoothie at the same time.
INFO:root:[07:40] Ula (0.9998): 你喝
INFO:root:[07:40] Tom (0.9997): , 我也喝。 It was just silence, and then the sound of...
INFO:root:[07:43] Ula (1.0000): 没问题 , 没问题 , 没事
INFO:root:[07:45] Tom (0.9997): , 这是我们的广播。 Okay, 没事。
INFO:root:[07:47] Ula (0.9992): 我们可以做我们想做的事情。
INFO:root:[07:49] Tom (1.0000): We can, we're allowed to. Now, I want to speak about
INFO:root:[07:51] Ula (0.9999): Dale.
INFO:root:[07:53] Tom (1.0000): I want to talk about Dale.
INFO:root:[07:54] Ula (1.0000): 谁是 Dale?
INFO:root:Almost Anomaly: (6.149999999999762) ' I mean, I only a little bit about it because I've spoke to Dale very briefly on LinkedIn and I'm going to speak to him a bit more.'
INFO:root:[07:55] Tom (1.0000): Right, so Dale, Dale, Well, I don't know, actually. I mean, I only a little bit about it because I've spoke to Dale very briefly on LinkedIn and I'm going to speak to him a bit more. But a gentleman called Dale, who is like a tech guy, actually quite a senior tech guy and a product guy and an entrepreneur, I think from the States, right?
INFO:root:[08:16] Ula (0.9998): Atlanta.
INFO:root:[08:19] Tom (1.0000): Yeah, yeah. In the States, right? Obviously very, very smart guy. He has been working on a problem.
INFO:root:Detected episode: 
INFO:root:[08:56] have problem.
INFO:root:[08:56] Tom (1.0000): English or one language. Now, the thing is, they contact us, they go, love your show. It was a great episode on insert episode here. When you talked about insert episode description here, it's just like a mass email thing, right? And they say, I think it would be really great. Now I reply, hey, that's cool. Sounds great. We'd love to, you know, because I'm super interested in getting transcription services because for our listeners, a transcript would be probably really useful Right,
INFO:root:[09:52] Ula (1.0000): sometimes
INFO:root:[09:54] Tom (1.0000): Now, Dale has taken it upon himself, being an enterprising gentleman, to try and solve that problem. And I think it's
INFO:root:[10:02] Ula (0.9986): partially
INFO:root:[10:03] Tom (1.0000): solved. I don't know. I mean, Dale can totally correct me. I don't know if it's completely solved, but he's much closer than anyone we've spoken to so far in regards to. He sent us along a sample of it.
INFO:root:[10:15] Ula (0.9827): But
INFO:root:[10:16] Tom (0.9999): I still think there is some elements of manual checking that he's had to do.
INFO:root:[10:23] Ula (1.0000): That's the problem.
INFO:root:[10:27] Ula (1.0000): Yeah, yeah. How
INFO:root:Detected episode: 3
INFO:root:[10:47] Tom (1.0000): close are you saying some of it was wrong for your side, was it?
INFO:root:[10:51] Ula (0.9999): 我觉得大概有 10%,20% 的字是不对的。
INFO:root:[10:54] Tom (0.9999): That's good.
INFO:root:[10:54] Ula (1.0000): 对啊 , 已经很好了。
INFO:root:[10:57] Tom (1.0000): If it's close enough.
INFO:root:[10:57] Ula (0.9999): 对 , 可是它没有翻译全部的 episode,  它是翻译可能一分钟 , 一分钟两分钟的 audio,  然后 another episode for another one minute, two minutes.  所以它不是整集的 , 全部的那个字幕。
INFO:root:[11:19] Tom (1.0000): Yeah, I'm super interested by it. I think like it'd be fascinating. I mean, obviously one day it can be done, I think.  我不知道。 The problem is how do you distinguish between two languages if you
INFO:root:[11:35] Ula (1.0000): mix them?  因为在这个 Dell 他给我们的 transcript 里面有一句话就是我们好像说了英文和中文 , Chinglish, right?  然后他的那个翻译是全部都是中文。
INFO:root:[11:50] Tom (1.0000): Yeah.
INFO:root:[11:50] Ula (1.0000): 他没有翻英文。 That's the point.  所以就变成了他找了一个最近的中文的 pronunciation, 然后就放在里面。 Yeah, yeah, yeah. And
INFO:root:[11:59] Tom (1.0000): the problem is like with pronunciations that, for example, what comes to mind like  给我。 So if I said something like  嗯  给咪  给咪 Yeah? If I mixed... If I used  亲 in that instance, it would pick up the word  给 for English because it sounds so similar to the word English.
INFO:root:[12:26] Ula (0.9984): 对 As
INFO:root:[12:27] Tom (0.9813): well, right?  对
INFO:root:[12:28] Ula (0.9999): , 就是很近的音  英文跟中文很近的音 Yeah, when they're real
INFO:root:[12:32] Tom (0.9999): close.
INFO:root:[12:33] Ula (1.0000): 对 , 它会  起司
INFO:root:[12:36] Tom (0.9997): Close, right? Maybe it wouldn't pick that up.
INFO:root:[12:38] Tom (1.0000): Do you know what I mean? It's like words like that.  谁 or something. How would it distinguish between the fact that, oh, that's a That's a Zhonglish. That's a Zhongwen word. And that's an English word. I don't know, but Dale knows.
INFO:root:[12:49] Ula (0.9999): He did pick
INFO:root:[12:50] Tom (1.0000): some
INFO:root:[12:51] Ula (0.9999): Chinglish sentence in the script.
INFO:root:[12:53] Tom (1.0000): Yeah. I think that's manually done.  我想我们的广播的想法是很好的。 Sorry, did you hear that? I don't know
INFO:root:[13:34] Ula (1.0000): when it will come out.
INFO:root:[13:38] Tom (1.0000): I wonder if the translation will pick that up. Unknown. Unknown sound. Yeah. We spoke about like a network of bilingual podcasts, which have the same idea. You don't mean a Spanish host and an English host
INFO:root:[13:54] Ula (0.9998): who
INFO:root:[13:54] Tom (0.9999): understands Spanish speaking. Dan said that the transcripts would be very useful. I think it should be useful. So thank you, Dale, for working on that. And I hope it's,
INFO:root:[14:04] Ula (0.9945): if
INFO:root:[14:05] Tom (1.0000): anything, like Dale's obviously studying being I hope if anything, the project gives you something enjoyable to do currently, you know, whilst you're busy doing other stuff, cause it's like enjoyable to do. It gives you a project to, to try and figure out. We have a good, a good friend of ours also called Alex, who is a developer.
INFO:root:[14:24] Ula (0.9980): Yeah.
INFO:root:Almost Anomaly: (6.750000000000069) ' He helped us build an uploader for our app and all this kind of stuff.'
INFO:root:[14:25] Tom (1.0000): He also nearly took on that problem. He, he, he was, he got swamped by other things. He helped us build an uploader for our app and all this kind of stuff. He's a lovely guy. But he also, he also said, Ooh, that's a good problem. So today I will record a video  但是我需要开始  我需要说中文  因为我需要介绍  小红书  我需要介绍  因为美国 They're looking to ban TikTok on the 19th Which is upset a lot of people So  很多美国人  他们去 download  下载  下载吗 ?
INFO:root:[15:25] Ula (1.0000): Yeah  下载
INFO:root:[15:25] Tom (0.9999): 下载  这个 APP 是  小红包  小红包
INFO:root:[15:31] Ula (1.0000): 小红包 Little envelope.
INFO:root:[15:35] Tom (1.0000): It's Chinese owned Chinese app or social media company. Basically it's TikTok, but in China. And it's the most downloaded app on the UK app store. Like most of European countries, American app store is like the number one right now. And I make a video joking about it, basically.  因为很多人现在他们是要学中文。 So now is like a great time to come over to Mandarin Monkey and learn for sure.
INFO:root:[16:14] Ula (1.0000): 这里很好笑 , 我打了小红书 , 然后找那个新闻。  然后真的就是全部 , including BBC,  它就说 TikTok 难民 ,
INFO:root:[16:24] Tom (0.9999): they call it
INFO:root:[16:25] Ula (0.9990): refugees.
INFO:root:[16:25] Tom (0.9996): 难民
INFO:root:[16:26] Ula (0.9993): , 永向另一个中国的平台。
INFO:root:[16:31] Tom (0.9876): TikTok
INFO:root:[16:32] Ula (1.0000): is banned.  但是他们又去了另外一个也是中国的平台。  然后 , 对啊 , 好多人都在说 , like,  这是一个很有趣的 behavior.
INFO:root:[16:45] Tom (0.9999): It's interesting. And the American public are sort of doing it just to spite the government in the sense of like, you know, you're trying to ban it because we're giving our, you don't want to share our data with China. Now we're going to share our data with China voluntarily. Wow. It's interesting. And people like Mr. Beast, for example, are trying to buy TikTok. Really?
INFO:root:[17:39] Tom (1.0000): Just turn it
INFO:root:[17:53] Ula (1.0000): into their own. Turn TikTok into American.
INFO:root:[17:56] Tom (0.9984): Yeah. Now TikTok are refusing. They're saying, no, we're not, we're not selling to you guys. We're no, um,
INFO:root:[18:04] Ula (1.0000): yeah,
INFO:root:[18:05] Tom (0.9015): but, um,
INFO:root:[18:07] Ula (0.9800): well, I guess
INFO:root:[18:08] Tom (1.0000): it's, it's, I mean, I don't know. I won't visit cause I won't visit our, CEO or board, but like, um, maybe pride, maybe it makes, maybe it makes way more money than what they're being offered. Um, when?
INFO:root:[18:21] Ula (0.9998): When are they going to do it?
INFO:root:[18:23] Tom (1.0000): 19th Sunday, I think.
INFO:root:[18:25] Ula (0.9998): Oh,
INFO:root:[18:26] Tom (0.9965): 19th. Yeah, literally on Sunday, there's going to be an America-wide ban, shutdown of TikTok. I don't know how they're going to... They're apparently going to shut down the servers. So it's just going to go, not for us.
INFO:root:[18:39] Ula (1.0000): 欸 , 他说这里台湾也会用欸。
INFO:root:[18:42] Tom (1.0000): We'll miss them. Huh? I'll miss them. You don't really use TikTok, do you?  我不用。 Yeah.
INFO:root:[18:48] Ula (0.9981): 我觉得太多了。
INFO:root:[18:50] Tom (0.9998): 太多什么 ?  太多东西了。 You're still one of the old school, that's why.
INFO:root:[18:55] Ula (1.0000): 不是
INFO:root:[18:57] Tom (0.9724): , 我是觉得都一样。 You're guarding the old school.
INFO:root:[18:59] Ula (1.0000): 没有啊 , 因为我有 Facebook, 我有脸书嘛 , 然后也有 Instagram, 但是是 Mandarin Monkey 的 Instagram 。  然后还有 , 之前我有看过 TikTok, 可是大家都是在上面跳舞。
INFO:root:[19:12] Tom (1.0000): It's not just that.  一前啊 , 以前。 Yeah, yeah, yeah, but once the algorithm sort of picks up how old you are, you just see your own, what the stuff you like. Because that's what it does, like the whole point in the swan farmer.  对啊
INFO:root:[19:25] Ula (1.0000): , 算法。  可是脸书的算法也是一样啊。 Right?  然后 Instagram,  我觉得 Instagram 跟 TikTok,  他们好像哦。
INFO:root:[19:34] Tom (1.0000): 我不想。
INFO:root:[19:36] Ula (0.9995): 你觉得 ?

INFO:root:[24:24] Ula (1.0000): 我觉得如果你把中文说得很好 , it's a twist.

INFO:root:[24:31] Ula (1.0000): 很难耶 , 你要怎么来假装自己说得不好 ? Don't you think? It's hard
INFO:root:[24:38] Tom (0.9990): to pretend.

INFO:root:[27:21] Ula (1.0000): Yeah. Yeah, but I think it's very rude. I understand. Because, okay, if
INFO:root:[27:26] Tom (0.7109): you
INFO:root:[27:27] Ula (1.0000): want to make a joke today, right? Like, you. You should put on some subtitle.
INFO:root:[27:34] Tom (0.9998): Like
INFO:root:[27:35] Ula (0.9999): the real thing. Like that doesn't mean I love you. Doesn't mean
INFO:root:[27:39] Tom (1.0000): I words. You
INFO:root:[27:40] Ula (1.0000): need to tell everyone. Because some people will look at things on the internet and then spread the words. Do you understand?
INFO:root:[27:48] Tom (1.0000): Maybe he really doesn't like foreigners.
INFO:root:[27:50] Tom (0.9996): 啊
INFO:root:[27:50] Ula (1.0000): 所以我就说啊  这是一种 Unkind
INFO:root:[27:55] Tom (0.9999): joke
INFO:root:[27:55] Ula (1.0000): 我觉得开玩笑有分好的跟不好的  但是我觉得他们是有一种 attack  的感觉
INFO:root:[28:02] Tom (0.9998): Yeah  对
INFO:root:[28:03] Ula (0.9261): 我觉得 No
INFO:root:[28:04] Tom (1.0000): I feel you I feel you Just be careful that's all

INFO:root:[28:59] Ula (1.0000): , 我觉得这种行为 , 这种 behavior  是我很不喜欢 , 只是因为 like people
INFO:root:[29:05] Tom (0.9976): will
INFO:root:[29:05] Ula (0.9999): put on  很不好的 reputation
INFO:root:[29:08] Tom (1.0000): on
INFO:root:[29:08] Ula (1.0000): Mandarin, Chinese  所以我不想要让大家  我不想要让大家觉得  说中文 is a
INFO:root:[29:14] Tom (1.0000): rude
INFO:root:[29:14] Ula (1.0000): thing to do  我觉得这不太 ,it's not fair  因为这是我的 mother tongue, right?  所以如果我去美国  然后我说中文 and people think I'm
INFO:root:[29:26] Tom (1.0000): rude Like,
INFO:root:[29:27] Ula (0.9998): no, this is my language. Like, don't do that to my language.
INFO:root:[29:31] Tom (1.0000): I think, I think actually this shows the amount of people that have gone over to Songzhou is, is proof that the real people don't care as much as the government make it out they do about China or the language or anything like that.
INFO:root:[29:47] Tom (1.0000): Do you know what I mean? I think, I think we, we saw a dip in people who, who wanted to learn Zongwen because of, the government over there, right?
INFO:root:[29:58] Ula (0.9976): Yeah.
INFO:root:[29:58] Tom (1.0000): And then what was going around? Are you dizzy? your throat? Okay. I'm
INFO:root:[30:04] Ula (1.0000): letting the beast out.
INFO:root:[30:05] Tom (1.0000): And I hope this, this sort of picks it back up because.
INFO:root:[30:08] Ula (1.0000): I think adults, obviously.
INFO:root:[30:11] Tom (0.9534): It ain't what they say.
INFO:root:[30:12] Ula (1.0000): Yeah. I think adults, obviously we can't avoid them. We can't control them.
INFO:root:[30:17] Tom (0.9992): We
INFO:root:[30:17] Ula (1.0000): can't control them. But I'm worried about children. Like young people. Because they, they,  他们太年轻 , 他们还不懂就是什么是对的 , 跟什么是不对的。
INFO:root:[30:31] Tom (1.0000): 对啊 , 但是我们的孩子是不一样。
INFO:root:[30:33] Ula (0.9999): 对啊 , 只是在英国我们还没有这个问题啦 , 对不对 ?  但是在美国 , 他们的小孩 , 他们年轻人 , 他们会需要 ,  他们如果真的在小红书上面看到一些很 crazy 的影片 , 很疯狂的影片 ,  他们会觉得 that's
INFO:root:[30:51] Tom (0.9999): true, that's real world. Yeah.
INFO:root:[30:54] Ula (1.0000): Yeah,
INFO:root:[30:57] Tom (0.9941): no, I get it. Yeah. But, but, but, but, uh, I mean, this is not the end of anything. I mean,
INFO:root:[31:05] Ula (0.9993): I'd
INFO:root:[31:06] Tom (0.9999): be surprised if they actually did it. If they actually turn everything off, that'd be interesting.
INFO:root:[31:12] Ula (0.9683): Yeah.
INFO:root:[31:13] Tom (0.9999): Well, we don't know. I mean, I, someone could buy it. The government could, I mean, there's, there's senators now who are trying to, um, put delays on the ban. to try and understand it better because it's annoying so many people. Like 150 million people, 170 million people are really quite annoyed by this. So like that's a lot. That's like half your country. You know, half America, whatever it is.
INFO:root:[31:39] Ula (0.9999): don't know
INFO:root:[31:46] Tom (1.0000): what we were talking about because I just got a phone call and I had to answer it because it was about money.  我的工作是一个经理吗 ?  我们的经济是我的问题。
INFO:root:[31:59] Ula (0.9999): 辛苦你了。
INFO:root:[32:02] Tom (1.0000): So I had to answer that, apologies.  我忘记了 , 我们的对话是什么。 Probably TikTok and  小红书。
INFO:root:[32:10] Ula (1.0000): 对 , 我刚好好像是要问你 ,  如果 TikTok 真的不见 ,  你不觉得它会 completely 不见 ?
INFO:root:[32:17] Tom (1.0000): Well, it's hard to believe, isn't it? An entire America.  对。 An entire social network.  可是为什么 ?
INFO:root:[32:25] Ula (1.0000): 为什么 TikTok 这么的重要 ?  就是因为如果没有 TikTok,  他们还是有 Instagram,  他们还是有 X 。
INFO:root:[32:31] Tom (1.0000): Because the government, because X is owned by Americans, so is Twitter. Sorry, so is Meta, so is Instagram. TikTok is not owned by Americans. It's owned in Singapore. And it's partially owned by the Chinese government. Okay. And the American government do not want China. They think China is stealing the data of all the Americans and using it for, I don't know what they think. Oh. Honestly, I haven't listened to the, what the government's point of view is in depth, but.
INFO:root:[33:05] Ula (0.9999): So they
INFO:root:[33:06] Tom (1.0000): don't, they just don't want the Chinese government to have access to American data. So they want to.
INFO:root:[33:15] Ula (1.0000): I understand. is the users. I mean.
INFO:root:[33:17] Tom (1.0000): Yeah.
INFO:root:[33:19] Ula (1.0000): 他们觉得 TikTok 真的好重要 , 真的好重要。 If it completely disappeared, my life is ruined.
INFO:root:[33:26] Tom (0.9970): 这种态度 , 这种想法。 For example, there are 5 million American businesses on TikTok. 5 million American businesses that sell on TikTok and make a
INFO:root:[33:35] Ula (1.0000): living.
INFO:root:[33:36] Tom (1.0000): It will close them down entirely. And there are millions of creators who make money from TikTok.
INFO:root:[33:42] Ula (1.0000): 你说他们很多美国公司会在 TikTok 上面卖东西到亚洲去
INFO:root:[33:46] Tom (0.9999): , 是吗 ? Yeah. Yeah. Well, you know, they sell stuff, whatever their business is, I don't know, online. Because there's TikTok shops and stuff where they sell their merchandise and whatever they do.
INFO:root:[33:57] Ula (1.0000): Yeah.
INFO:root:[33:57] Tom (1.0000): They will close down completely. And creators who have spent years building millions of followers.
INFO:root:[34:03] Ula (0.9999): Oh no, But
INFO:root:[34:04] Tom (1.0000): like they make money from it. That's sad. It feels like you're being sarcastic.
INFO:root:[34:10] Ula (1.0000): Of course. Of course.
INFO:root:[34:12] Tom (0.9442): No, no, no.
INFO:root:[34:13] Ula (1.0000): I feel like it's too serious. How
INFO:root:[34:16] Tom (0.9999): would you feel that?
INFO:root:[34:19] Ula (1.0000): 因为我觉得就是大家把它看得太严重啊。
INFO:root:[34:22] Tom (1.0000): Yeah, but think, if our main income source comes from YouTube and they shut it down, how annoyed would we be?
INFO:root:[34:32] Ula (1.0000): 我懂啦 , 我懂 , 可是你还是 , like TikTok 它也是一个 platform, right?
INFO:root:[34:37] Tom (1.0000): Yeah.
INFO:root:[34:38] Ula (0.9993): So are other ones.  其他也有其他的平台啊。
INFO:root:[34:43] Tom (1.0000): 但是 ,you have to build,  你需要盖你的平台。 From the start, from zero, again.  好喔。 If me and you built 10 million followers on YouTube and they shut it down, and we have no followers on the other platforms, you have to start again. And it took you a decade to get to 10 million.
INFO:root:[35:03] Ula (1.0000): 然后小红书 can replace.
INFO:root:[35:04] Tom (1.0000): Now they're hoping that anything...
INFO:root:[35:06] Ula (1.0000): 所以他们会把他们的工作 , 他们的公司
INFO:root:[35:10] Tom (0.9382): , 搬到小红书去。  我不知道。  我不知道他们的公司 ,  但是我想他们 joined  小红书因为 it will annoy the government. Because the whole government's point is you'll give, we don't want you to share your data with China. And then the American citizens are going, we're going to voluntarily share our data with China as a choice.
INFO:root:[35:31] Ula (1.0000): And 现在 , I'm sure,  在美国的政府 , 他们一定知道小红书 exist, right?
INFO:root:[35:38] Tom (1.0000): 我不知道。  一定知道 , 一定知道。 No, no, you think that, but. I've heard, and this could be social media, but like there are senators on there who barely know technology. Like, do I have to connect to Wi-Fi to get on a TikTok? That kind of thing.
INFO:root:[36:00] Ula (1.0000): 我说的是政府耶。 Government.
INFO:root:[36:03] Tom (1.0000): Yes, the government. Yes, I'm saying there's politicians, senators in there who don't know technology enough to understand how it works.
INFO:root:[36:10] Ula (1.0000): 新闻很大耶。 Right?  新闻很简单 , easy to access to.  所以他们如果知道 TikTok,  他们一定知道小红书。 Now,  现在如果他们知道 ,  现在如果政府知道 , OK,  大家全部都去小红书 , So what?  小红书 is the next target. Yeah.
INFO:root:[36:30] Tom (0.9999): Well, they'll have to keep banning everything.
INFO:root:[36:33] Ula (1.0000): OK,  好 ,  所以我觉得你刚刚讲到一个 good point,  就是如果是 about business, I
INFO:root:[36:38] Tom (0.9970): agree,
INFO:root:[36:38] Ula (1.0000): I feel bad for them.  如果他支持他们的生意 , 他们的公司的话 ,  当然我支持他们 ,  他们要找另外一个平台 , that is easy to sell the stuff,
INFO:root:[36:51] Tom (0.9873): 我懂。
INFO:root:[36:51] Ula (1.0000): 但是不要为了要去 annoy  政府 , so to do it.
INFO:root:Almost Anomaly: (6.674999999996181) ' Do you know what I mean?'
INFO:root:[36:57] Tom (0.9994): 你懂我的意思吗 ? The users are doing it, because they're not going to have a social media platform. They don't enjoy meta, because it's old, it's done. Neither with Instagram, it's done. Twitter is different. Twitter is not a video content platform. it's a news, like instant news kind of thing. There's no other platform that's like TikTok currently. I mean, there's like Snapchat and stuff, but it's not, it's not for those things.
INFO:root:[37:23] Tom (1.0000): Do you know what I mean? So they're like rebelling and basically saying we're going to find something else. And I don't know if the government knew about Shang Shu, but now they do because millions and millions and millions of people are joining it. And they, I bet you in a meeting room somewhere, they went, ah, shoot. Shoot. They're all joining.
INFO:root:[37:42] Ula (0.9999): 可是这个没有方法 , 没有办法去解决。  如果真的 …
INFO:root:[37:49] Tom (1.0000): 你要做中国的事。
INFO:root:[37:50] Ula (1.0000): 我的意思是想说 , 如果真的很多中国的 spy,  他们来 TikTok, 然后要偷大家的资料 ,  那美国可以找一个很厉害的团队 ,  然后建立一个大战争 ,
INFO:root:[38:11] Tom (0.9898): Firewall.
INFO:root:[38:12] Tom (1.0000): Firewall, yeah.
INFO:root:[38:13] Ula (1.0000): Right? To stop that happen.  那在美国的人 ,  他们的如果想要把他们的产品  卖到亚洲 , 卖到中国 , They still can keep their business going.  因为他们有一个保护啊 , right?  所以应该不需要 like being so extreme.  他们还是可以找办法 to try and keep TikTok going.  然后 maybe build a firewall  去保护美国人 ,  他们的隐私。  对不对 ?  我觉得啦 , 这只是一个 discussion, right?  我觉得政府可以这么做 ,  然后让在美国的公司不要 lose their business, lose their
INFO:root:[38:55] Tom (0.9999): jobs. Yeah. The government don't care, obviously, because they're banning it. The senators and whatever, they don't care about that, obviously, because it's overwhelmingly they voted to ban it.
INFO:root:[39:06] Ula (1.0000): 所以 again, like back to  政治 , 就是 They ruin everything.
INFO:root:[39:12] Tom (0.9999): It's a stupid thing to do. They
INFO:root:[39:16] Ula (1.0000): think they're our rivals. So we have to let them come into our country.
INFO:root:[39:24] Tom (1.0000): They're going to have to ban Redbook now.
INFO:root:[39:30] Ula (0.9998): In
INFO:root:[39:31] Tom (0.9999): America. Where
INFO:root:[39:33] Tom (0.9964): are they going to go? What's that?
INFO:root:[39:39] Ula (1.0000): What's that? Line.
INFO:root:[39:41] Tom (1.0000): No, no, that's not a video sharing platform. No.
INFO:root:[39:46] Ula (0.9988): Where else?
INFO:root:[39:47] Tom (1.0000): I don't know. I didn't even know Xiaohongshu existed.
INFO:root:[39:50] Ula (0.9888): Oh, you don't know?
INFO:root:[39:51] Tom (0.9999): No, not until this whole thing. That's the point. I had no idea.
INFO:root:[39:56] Ula (1.0000): They're
INFO:root:[39:57] Tom (0.9999): In China, but not over here. Now they're big over here because of that. Because of TikTok's closing down. But that's the point. I had no idea. I bet you that the government didn't even know. But now they do because it's so... Now it's... Okay.  还好吗 ?  我妈的孩子。  对对对。  她有问题。
INFO:root:[40:16] Ula (1.0000): 对。  她还好。
INFO:root:[40:17] Tom (0.9824): He fell over.
INFO:root:[40:18] Ula (0.7605): Yeah.

INFO:root:[40:20] Tom (0.9974): , 没事。 Good.

INFO:root:[40:26] Ula (1.0000): 大家 , calm down,  冷静。  不要。
INFO:root:[40:30] Tom (0.9996): So that was it, you know, that's it.
INFO:root:[40:31] Ula (0.9998): 冷静 , 冷静。
INFO:root:[40:33] Tom (1.0000): One of the things is, you know, I'll tell you what I know about, just so I go back to transcripts. Well, I use, ChatGPT.
INFO:root:[41:07] Ula (1.0000): can't watch our
INFO:root:[41:08] Tom (0.9999): video. No, no, no, it can't. But, but, but, uh, you have to, you know, you have to use some kind of AI tool like Dale is sort of building or whatever, uh, to transcribe the episode. And then you download that as a PDF, put it in chat GPT. Hey, can you transcribe this for me? You know?
INFO:root:[41:24] Tom (1.0000): So I manually have to listen to our show when I edit it and then type it in and say like that we this and that and we discussed this and you know what I mean? So it's a whole thing.
INFO:root:[41:35] Ula (1.0000): Yeah.
